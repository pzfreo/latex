                  Language (SWSL), which is used to specify the
                  Semantic Web Services Ontology (SWSO) as well as
                  individual Web services. The language consists of
                  two parts: SWSL-FOL, a full first-order logic
                  language, and SWSL-Rules, as rule-based
                  language. SWSL-FOL is primarily used for formal
                  specification of the ontology and is intended to
                  provide interoperability with other first-order
                  based process models and service ontologies. In
                  contrast, SWSL-Rules is designed to be an actual
                  language for service specification. },
